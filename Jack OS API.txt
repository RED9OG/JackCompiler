The Jack OS API
The Jack language comes with a collection of eight built-in classes that extend the language’s
capabilities. This standard library can be viewed as a basic operating system. This document
gives the OS API.

Math
A library of commonly used mathematical functions.
returns the product of x and y. When a Jack compiler
detects the multiplication operator ‘*’ in the program's code, it handles it by invoking this
method. In other words, the Jack expressions x*y and Math.multiply(x,y) return the same
value.

function int multiply(int x, int y):

function int divide(int x, int y): returns the integer part of x/y. When a Jack compiler detects
the division operator ‘/’ in the program's code, it handles it by invoking this method. In
other words, the Jack expressions x/y and Math.divide(x,y) return the same value.
function int min(int x, int y):

returns the minimum of x and y.

function int max(int x, int y):

returns the maximum of x and y.

function int sqrt(int x):

returns the integer part of the square root of x.

String
The String class represents character strings. In addition for constructing and disposing strings,
the class features methods for getting and setting individual characters of the string, for erasing
the string’s last character, for appending a character to the string’s end, and more typical stringoriented operations.
constructor String new(int maxLength):
of maxLength and initial length of 0.
method int dispose():
method int length():

constructs a new empty string with a maximum length

disposes this string.

returns the current length of this string.

method char charAt(int j):

returns the character at the j-th location of this string.

method void setCharAt(int j, char c):
method String appendChar(char c):
method void eraseLastChar():
method int intValue():

sets the character at the j-th location of this string to c.

appends c to this string’s end and returns this string.

erases the last character from this string.

returns the integer value of this string, until a non-digit char is detected.

method void setInt(int val):
function char backSpace():

returns the backspace character.

function char doubleQuote():
function char newLine():

sets this string to hold a representation of the given value.
returns the double quote (") character.

returns the newline character.

Array
Represents an array. In the Jack language, arrays are instances of the Array class. Once declared,
the array entries can be accessed using the usual syntax arr[i]. Each array entry can hold a
primitive data type or any object type. Different array entries can have different data types.
function Array new(int size):
method void dispose():

constructs a new array of the given size.

disposes this array.

Output
A library of functions for displaying text on the screen.
The Hack physical screen consists of 512 rows of 256 pixels each. The library uses a fixed font,
in which each character is displayed within a frame which is 11 pixels high (including 1 pixel for
inter-line spacing) and 8 pixels wide (including 2 pixels for inter-character spacing). The
resulting grid accommodates 23 rows (indexed 0..22, top to bottom) of 64 characters each
(indexed 0..63, left to right). The top left character position on the screen is indexed (0,0). A
cursor, implemented as a small filled square, indicates where the next character will be displayed.
moves the cursor to the j-th column of the i-th row,
and erases the character displayed there.

function void moveCursor(int i, int j):

displays the given character at the cursor location, and
advances the cursor one column forward.

function void printChar(char c):

displays the given string starting at the cursor location,
and advances the cursor appropriately.

function void printString(String s):

displays the given integer starting at the cursor location, and
advances the cursor appropriately.

function void printInt(int i):
function void println():

advances the cursor to the beginning of the next line.

function void backSpace():

moves the cursor one column back.

Screen
A library of functions for displaying graphics on the screen. The Hack physical screen consists of
512 rows (indexed 0..511, top to bottom) of 256 pixels each (indexed 0..255, left to right). The
top left pixel on the screen is indexed (0,0).
function void clearScreen():

erases the entire screen.

sets the current color, to be used for all subsequent drawXXX
commands. Black is represented by true, white by false.

function void setColor(boolean b):

function void drawPixel(int x, int y):

draws the (x,y) pixel, using the current color.

function void drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2):
pixel (x2,y2), using the current color.

draws a line from pixel (x1,y1) to

function void drawRectangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2): draws a filled rectangle whose
top left corner is (x1,y1) and bottom right corner is (x2,y2), using the current color.
function void drawCircle(int x, int y, int r):
(x,y), using the current color.

Jack OS API, www.nand2tetris.org

draws a filled circle of radius r ≤ 181 around

Keyboard
This class allows reading inputs from a standard keyboard.
returns the character of the currently pressed key on the keyboard;
if no key is currently pressed, returns 0. Recognizes all ASCII characters, as well as the
following keys: newline (128=String.newline()), backspace (129=String.backspace()),
left arrow (130), up arrow (131), right arrow (132), down arrow (133), home (134), end
(135), page up (136), page down (137), insert (138), delete (139), ESC (140), F1-F12
(141-152).

function char keyPressed():

waits until a key is pressed on the keyboard and released, then echoes
the key to the screen and returns the character of the pressed key.

function char readChar():

function String readLine(String message): displays the message on the screen, reads from the
keyboard the entered text until a newline character is detected, echoes the text to the screen,

and returns its value. Also handles user backspaces.
function int readInt(String message): displays the message on the screen, reads from the
keyboard the entered text until a newline character is detected, echoes the text to the screen,

and returns its integer value (until the first non-digit character in the entered text is
detected). Also handles user backspaces.

Memory
This library provides two services: direct access to the computer’s main memory (RAM), and
allocation and recycling of memory blocks. The Hack RAM consists of 32,768 words, each holding
a 16-bit binary number.
function int peek(int address):

returns the RAM value at the given address.

function void poke(int address, int value):

sets the RAM value at the given address to the given

value.
finds an available RAM block of the given size and returns a
reference to its base address.

function Array alloc(int size):

de-allocates the given object (cast as an array) by making it
available for future allocations.

function void deAlloc(Array o):

Sys
A library that supports various program execution services.
function void halt():

halts the program execution.

function void error(int errorCode): displays the given error
"ERR<errorCode>", and halts the program's execution.
function void wait(int duration):

code in the form

waits approximately duration milliseconds and returns.
